# Two projects I made using Dataquest

I follow the course 'web programming' during my studies at Fontys ACI. In this course I was allowed to choose a programming language I wanted to learn and I chose Python. I started learning the language via Dataquest.io, where I chose the careerpath Data scientist in Python. On this page I share the projects I have made. 

# Project 1:
For this project I have to pretend that I'm working as data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store. The company only builds apps that are free to download and install and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. 
My goal for this project is to analyse data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

# Project 2: 
In this project I worked with a dataset from Hacker News. Hacker News is a site where user-submitted posts are voted and KOHmented upon, similar to reddit. 
I'm especially interested in two kind of posts, Ask posts and Show posts. I calculated which kind of posts receive more comments on average and I calculated if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.
