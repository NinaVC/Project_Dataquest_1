# Two projects I made using Dataquest

# Project 1:
For this project I have to pretend that I'm working as data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store. The company only builds apps that are free to download and install and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. 
My goal for this project is to analyse data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
